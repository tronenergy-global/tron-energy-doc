# Smart hosting
## Frequently Asked Questions from Customers
- When I transfer money, why does the energy consumption differ each time?
- I transfer hundreds of transactions a day, but some require 32,000 and some require 65,000. How do I estimate how much it will cost?
- Can you auto-renew it for me since I canâ€™t remember it myself?
- My orders have suddenly increased in the past few days. How can I rent energy more cost-effectively?

Based on the above problems, we combined a large amount of customer data to launch a smart hosting service

## Principle
- **Based on the historical transfer volume of the account, the best energy is automatically estimated and entrusted through the algorithm**

- **The remaining energy of the account will be detected in real time and will be automatically replenished when the energy is insufficient**

Unless you are very familiar with the principles of energy delegation and consumption, it may not be as efficient as smart hosting. Of course, there are exceptions.

## Exceptions

- Your account has very few transfers per day, such as 1-2 transfers per day, or none. Smart hosting may cause waste
- Your account only carries out a few transactions every day, so it is not recommended to use this function.
