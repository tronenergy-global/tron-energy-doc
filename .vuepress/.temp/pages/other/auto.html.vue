<ul>
<li>When I transfer money, why does the energy consumption differ each time?</li>
<li>I transfer hundreds of transactions a day, but some require 32,000 and some require 65,000. How do I estimate how much it will cost?</li>
<li>Can you auto-renew it for me since I canâ€™t remember it myself?</li>
<li>My orders have suddenly increased in the past few days. How can I rent energy more cost-effectively?</li>
</ul>
<p>Based on the above problems, we combined a large amount of customer data to launch a smart hosting service</p>
<h2 id="principle" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#principle" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Principle</h2>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Based on the historical transfer volume of the account, the best energy is automatically estimated and entrusted through the algorithm</strong></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>The remaining energy of the account will be detected in real time and will be automatically replenished when the energy is insufficient</strong></p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Unless you are very familiar with the principles of energy delegation and consumption, it may not be as efficient as smart hosting. Of course, there are exceptions.</p>
<h2 id="exceptions" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#exceptions" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Exceptions</h2>
<ul>
<li>Your account has very few transfers per day, such as 1-2 transfers per day, or none. Smart hosting may cause waste</li>
<li>Your account only carries out a few transactions every day, so it is not recommended to use this function.</li>
</ul>
